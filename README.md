Hi, I am a Computer Sciences student in Ghent. Get to know me!

## Who am I?
I am a motivated Computer Sciences student in Ghent, Belgium. I am often busy with a lot of things like basketball, music and of course delving into the world of software. I like to work on projects where I can bring these passions together. In my free time I do a lot of sports and here too I go to extremes. In projects I work very well in teams, this is largely due to my 18 years of experience in basketball.

## What can I do?
In the past I have had projects and jobs from which I have learned a lot. As a job student I worked at Helan and set up a new database here, currently I manage the software for managing IPads there. 
**Soft skills**
Creative, flexible, critical, collaborative and out-of-the-box thinking.
**Hard skills**
Date Engineering & AI: Python, Machnine Learning, ...
Mainframe expert: PL/I, COBOL, DB2, IMS, ...
Development: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, ...

**Bachelor's thesis**
For my back office I created an application where real-time feedback is given on the performance of exercises at the kinesiologist using computer vision. 
Title: Optimization of body movements through integration of pose detection models in kinesiology practices. An investigation into the potential efficiency gains for kinesiologists.
This research is seen as a basis for further research that I will certainly conduct.

## What do I want?
My goal is to combine my passion for sports with my studies in Computer Sciences. Being able to realize something with technology in the world of sports is what drives me! My undergraduate thesis is a good starting point for this.
